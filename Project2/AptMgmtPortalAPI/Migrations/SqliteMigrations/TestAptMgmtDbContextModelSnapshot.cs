The TENANT must pay for all repairs, replacements, and damages, whether or not caused by the act or neglect of the TENANT. The TENANT will remove all of the TENANT's property at the end of this Lease. Any property that is left becomes the property of the LANDLORD and may be thrown out. All of TENANT'S garbage will be disposed of properly by TENANT in the appropriate receptacles for garbage collection. Accumulations of garbage in and around the PREMISES or depositing by TENANT or those residing with TENANT of garbage in areas not designated and designed as garbage receptacles shall constitute a violation of this lease.

15. SUBORDINATION: This Lease and the TENANT's rights are subject and subordinate to present and future mortgages on the property which include the PREMISES. The LANDLORD may execute any papers on the TENANT's behalf as the TENANT's attorney in fact to accomplish this.
16. HAZARDOUS USE: The TENANT will not keep anything in the PREMISES which is dangerous, flammable, explosive or which might increase the danger of fire or any other hazard, or which would increase LANDLORD's fire or hazard insurance.
17. INJURY OR DAMAGE: The TENANT will be responsible for any injury or damage caused by the act or neglect of the TENANT, the TENANT's employees or TENANT's visitors. The LANDLORD is not responsible for any injury or damage unless due to the negligence or improper conduct of the LANDLORD.
18. RENEWALS AND CHANGES IN LEASE: Upon expiration of the rental term provided for above, this lease shall automatically renew itself, indefinitely, for successive one-month periods, unless modified by the parties. The LANDLORD may modify this lease or offer the TENANT a new lease by forwarding to the TENANT a copy of the proposed changes or a copy of the new lease. If changes in this lease or a new lease are offered, the TENANT must notify the LANDLORD of the TENANT's decision to stay within thirty (30) days of the date the proposed changes or the copy of the new lease is received by the TENANT. If the TENANT fails to accept the lease changes or the new lease within thirty (30) days of the date the proposed changes or new lease is offered, the TENANT may be evicted by the LANDLORD, as provided for in State law. Nevertheless, if the rent is increased by the lease changes or new lease, the TENANT will be obligated to pay the new rent, regardless of whether the TENANT has affirmatively accepted the lease changes or new lease, if the TENANT continues to occupy the property on the date the new rent becomes effective.
19. PETS: No dogs, cats, or other animals are allowed on the PREMISES without the LANDLORD's prior written consent.
