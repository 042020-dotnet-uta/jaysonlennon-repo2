# Project Proposal - Apartment Management Portal

This project is a web application for apartment management designed to allow tenants to easily pay their rent and utilities, make maintenance requests, and view historical data.
Managers will be able to handle maintenance requests, view overdue rent and utility payments, view historical data, view and edit information about current tenants, and manage leases.
The application will be responsively designed, taking into account that many users will want to access the portal from their mobile devices.
